       "'Today is 5th September and like every year we have assembled here to celebrate the Teachers Day. I am extremely honored to have been given the opportunity to host this program. On the day of teacher’s day, I would like to talk about one of the greatest personalities who I admire a lot, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. I am sure everyone admires the great missile man for his notable contributions to our nation.\\n\\nDr. APJ Kalam has been a great motivation for me and his entire life journey has played a very significant role in transforming my life in a positive way.\\n\\nWe all know that Dr. Kalam was an Indian scientist and a benevolent politician who served India as the President from the year 2002 to 2007. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. Born on October 15, 1931, into a Muslim family, Dr. Kalam was a sharp student and an obedient child who helped his family in earning the livelihood. He was born in Dhanushkodi located on the southeastern coast of India. As a child, Dr. Kalam developed a great fascination with air travel by watching birds. This hobby of Kalam later developed into a mission to join aeronautics; the mission got stronger after he saw an article in the newspaper about a British fighter plane.\\n\\nHis father’s profession was to build and rent boats. Kalam was a very bright and hardworking student. He distributed newspapers in his locality to support his father. But he always had great interest towards studies; he was a very promising student and showed enormous likings towards science and mathematics. Dr. Kalam went to St. Joseph’s College after passing from school and attended Madras Institute of Technology to earn his degree in aeronautical engineering.'"

Several proof-of-concepts demos, such as AutoGPT, GPT-Engineer and BabyAGI, serve as inspiring examples. The potentiality of LLM extends beyond generating well-written copies, stories, essays and programs; it can be framed as a powerful general problem solver.\\nAgent System Overview#\\nIn a LLM-powered autonomous agent system, LLM functions as the agent’s brain, complemented by several key components:\\n\\nPlanning\\n\\nSubgoal and decomposition: The agent breaks down large tasks into smaller, manageable subgoals, enabling efficient handling of complex tasks.\\nReflection and refinement: The agent can do self-criticism and self-reflection over past actions, learn from mistakes and refine them for future steps, thereby improving the quality of final results.\\n\\n\\nMemory\\n\\nShort-term memory: I would consider all the in-context learning (See Prompt Engineering) as utilizing short-term memory of the model to learn.\\nLong-term memory: This provides the agent with the capability to retain and recall (infinite) information over extended periods, often by leveraging an external vector store and fast retrieval.\\n\\n\\nTool use\\n\\nThe agent learns to call external APIs for extra information that is missing from the model weights (often hard to change after pre-training), including current information, code execution capability, access to proprietary information sources and more.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 1. Overview of a LLM-powered autonomous agent system.\\nComponent One: Planning#\\nA complicated task usually involves many steps. An agent needs to know what they are and plan ahead.\\nTask Decomposition#\\nChain of thought (CoT; Wei et al. 2022) has become a standard prompting technique for enhancing model performance on complex tasks. The model is instructed to “think step by step” to utilize more test-time computation to decompose hard tasks into smaller and simpler steps. CoT transforms big tasks into multiple manageable tasks and shed lights into an interpretation of the model’s thinking process.\\nTree of Thoughts (Yao et al. 2023) extends CoT by exploring multiple reasoning possibilities at each step. It first decomposes the problem into multiple thought steps and generates multiple thoughts per step, creating a tree structure. The search process can be BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) with each state evaluated by a classifier (via a prompt) or majority vote.\\nTask decomposition can be done (1) by LLM with simple prompting like \"Steps for XYZ.\\\\n1.\", \"What are the subgoals for achieving XYZ?\", (2) by using task-specific instructions; e.g. \"Write a story outline.\" for writing a novel, or (3) with human inputs.\\nAnother quite distinct approach, LLM+P (Liu et al. 2023), involves relying on an external classical planner to do long-horizon planning. This approach utilizes the Planning Domain Definition Language (PDDL) as an intermediate interface to describe the planning problem. In this process, LLM (1) translates the problem into “Problem PDDL”, then (2) requests a classical planner to generate a PDDL plan based on an existing “Domain PDDL”, and finally (3) translates the PDDL plan back into natural language. Essentially, the planning step is outsourced to an external tool, assuming the availability of domain-specific PDDL and a suitable planner which is common in certain robotic setups but not in many other domains.\\nSelf-Reflection#\\nSelf-reflection is a vital aspect that allows autonomous agents to improve iteratively by refining past action decisions and correcting previous mistakes. It plays a crucial role in real-world tasks where trial and error are inevitable.\\nReAct (Yao et al. 2023) integrates reasoning and acting within LLM by extending the action space to be a combination of task-specific discrete actions and the language space. The former enables LLM to interact with the environment (e.g. use Wikipedia search API), while the latter prompting LLM to generate reasoning traces in natural language.\\nThe ReAct prompt template incorporates explicit steps for LLM to think, roughly formatted as:\\nThought: ...\\nAction: ...\\nObservation: ...\\n... (Repeated many times)\\n\\nFig. 2.  Examples of reasoning trajectories for knowledge-intensive tasks (e.g. HotpotQA, FEVER) and decision-making tasks (e.g. AlfWorld Env, WebShop). (Image source: Yao et al. 2023).\\nIn both experiments on knowledge-intensive tasks and decision-making tasks, ReAct works better than the Act-only baseline where Thought: … step is removed.\\nReflexion (Shinn & Labash 2023) is a framework to equips agents with dynamic memory and self-reflection capabilities to improve reasoning skills. Reflexion has a standard RL setup, in which the reward model provides a simple binary reward and the action space follows the setup in ReAct where the task-specific action space is augmented with language to enable complex reasoning steps. After each action $a_t$, the agent computes a heuristic $h_t$ and optionally may decide to reset the environment to start a new trial depending on the self-reflection results.\\n\\nFig. 3. Illustration of the Reflexion framework. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nThe heuristic function determines when the trajectory is inefficient or contains hallucination and should be stopped. Inefficient planning refers to trajectories that take too long without success. Hallucination is defined as encountering a sequence of consecutive identical actions that lead to the same observation in the environment.\\nSelf-reflection is created by showing two-shot examples to LLM and each example is a pair of (failed trajectory, ideal reflection for guiding future changes in the plan). Then reflections are added into the agent’s working memory, up to three, to be used as context for querying LLM.\\n\\nFig. 4. Experiments on AlfWorld Env and HotpotQA. Hallucination is a more common failure than inefficient planning in AlfWorld. (Image source: Shinn & Labash, 2023)\\nChain of Hindsight (CoH; Liu et al. 2023) encourages the model to improve on its own outputs by explicitly presenting it with a sequence of past outputs, each annotated with feedback. Human feedback data is a collection of $D_h = \\\\{(x, y_i , r_i , z_i)\\\\}_{i=1}^n$, where $x$ is the prompt, each $y_i$ is a model completion, $r_i$ is the human rating of $y_i$, and $z_i$ is the corresponding human-provided hindsight feedback. Assume the feedback tuples are ranked by reward, $r_n \\\\geq r_{n-1} \\\\geq \\\\dots \\\\geq r_1$ The process is supervised fine-tuning where the data is a sequence in the form of $\\\\tau_h = (x, z_i, y_i, z_j, y_j, \\\\dots, z_n, y_n)$, where $\\\\leq i \\\\leq j \\\\leq n$. The model is finetuned to only predict $y_n$ where conditioned on the sequence prefix, such that the model can self-reflect to produce better output based on the feedback sequence. The model can optionally receive multiple rounds of instructions with human annotators at test time.\\nTo avoid overfitting, CoH adds a regularization term to maximize the log-likelihood of the pre-training dataset. To avoid shortcutting and copying (because there are many common words in feedback sequences), they randomly mask 0% - 5% of past tokens during training.\\nThe training dataset in their experiments is a combination of WebGPT comparisons, summarization from human feedback and human preference dataset.\\n\\nFig. 5. After fine-tuning with CoH, the model can follow instructions to produce outputs with incremental improvement in a sequence. (Image source: Liu et al. 2023)\\nThe idea of CoH is to present a history of sequentially improved outputs  in context and train the model to take on the trend to produce better outputs. Algorithm Distillation (AD; Laskin et al. 2023) applies the same idea to cross-episode trajectories in reinforcement learning tasks, where an algorithm is encapsulated in a long history-conditioned policy. Considering that an agent interacts with the environment many times and in each episode the agent gets a little better, AD concatenates this learning history and feeds that into the model. Hence we should expect the next predicted action to lead to better performance than previous trials. The goal is to learn the process of RL instead of training a task-specific policy itself.\\n\\nFig. 6. Illustration of how Algorithm Distillation (AD) works. (Image source: Laskin et al. 2023).\\nThe paper hypothesizes that any algorithm that generates a set of learning histories can be distilled into a neural network by performing behavioral cloning over actions. The history data is generated by a set of source policies, each trained for a specific task. At the training stage, during each RL run, a random task is sampled and a subsequence of multi-episode history is used for training, such that the learned policy is task-agnostic.\\nIn reality, the model has limited context window length, so episodes should be short enough to construct multi-episode history. Multi-episodic contexts of 2-4 episodes are necessary to learn a near-optimal in-context RL algorithm. The emergence of in-context RL requires long enough context.\\nIn comparison with three baselines, including ED (expert distillation, behavior cloning with expert trajectories instead of learning history), source policy (used for generating trajectories for distillation by UCB), RL^2 (Duan et al. 2017; used as upper bound since it needs online RL), AD demonstrates in-context RL with performance getting close to RL^2 despite only using offline RL and learns much faster than other baselines. When conditioned on partial training history of the source policy, AD also improves much faster than ED baseline.\\n\\nFig. 7. Comparison of AD, ED, source policy and RL^2 on environments that require memory and exploration. Only binary reward is assigned. The source policies are trained with A3C for \"dark\" environments and DQN for watermaze.(Image source: Laskin et al. 2023)\\nComponent Two: Memory#\\n(Big thank you to ChatGPT for helping me draft this section. I’ve learned a lot about the human brain and data structure for fast MIPS in my conversations with ChatGPT.)\\nTypes of Memory#\\nMemory can be defined as the processes used to acquire, store, retain, and later retrieve information. There are several types of memory in human brains.\\n\\n\\nSensory Memory: This is the earliest stage of memory, providing the ability to retain impressions of sensory information (visual, auditory, etc) after the original stimuli have ended. Sensory memory typically only lasts for up to a few seconds. Subcategories include iconic memory (visual), echoic memory (auditory), and haptic memory (touch).\\n\\n\\nShort-Term Memory (STM) or Working Memory: It stores information that we are currently aware of and needed to carry out complex cognitive tasks such as learning and reasoning. Short-term memory is believed to have the capacity of about 7 items (Miller 1956) and lasts for 20-30 seconds.\\n\\n\\nLong-Term Memory (LTM): Long-term memory can store information for a remarkably long time, ranging from a few days to decades, with an essentially unlimited storage capacity. There are two subtypes of LTM:\\n\\nExplicit / declarative memory: This is memory of facts and events, and refers to those memories that can be consciously recalled, including episodic memory (events and experiences) and semantic memory (facts and concepts).\\nImplicit / procedural memory: This type of memory is unconscious and involves skills and routines that are performed automatically, like riding a bike or typing on a keyboard.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 8. Categorization of human memory.\\nWe can roughly consider the following mappings:\\n\\nSensory memory as learning embedding representations for raw inputs, including text, image or other modalities;\\nShort-term memory as in-context learning. It is short and finite, as it is restricted by the finite context window length of Transformer.\\nLong-term memory as the external vector store that the agent can attend to at query time, accessible via fast retrieval.\\n\\nMaximum Inner Product Search (MIPS)#\\nThe external memory can alleviate the restriction of finite attention span.  A standard practice is to save the embedding representation of information into a vector store database that can support fast maximum inner-product search (MIPS). To optimize the retrieval speed, the common choice is the approximate nearest neighbors (ANN)\\u200b algorithm to return approximately top k nearest neighbors to trade off a little accuracy lost for a huge speedup.\\nA couple common choices of ANN algorithms for fast MIPS:\\n\\nLSH (Locality-Sensitive Hashing): It introduces a hashing function such that similar input items are mapped to the same buckets with high probability, where the number of buckets is much smaller than the number of inputs.\\nANNOY (Approximate Nearest Neighbors Oh Yeah): The core data structure are random projection trees, a set of binary trees where each non-leaf node represents a hyperplane splitting the input space into half and each leaf stores one data point. Trees are built independently and at random, so to some extent, it mimics a hashing function. ANNOY search happens in all the trees to iteratively search through the half that is closest to the query and then aggregates the results. The idea is quite related to KD tree but a lot more scalable.\\nHNSW (Hierarchical Navigable Small World): It is inspired by the idea of small world networks where most nodes can be reached by any other nodes within a small number of steps; e.g. “six degrees of separation” feature of social networks. HNSW builds hierarchical layers of these small-world graphs, where the bottom layers contain the actual data points. The layers in the middle create shortcuts to speed up search. When performing a search, HNSW starts from a random node in the top layer and navigates towards the target. When it can’t get any closer, it moves down to the next layer, until it reaches the bottom layer. Each move in the upper layers can potentially cover a large distance in the data space, and each move in the lower layers refines the search quality.\\nFAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search): It operates on the assumption that in high dimensional space, distances between nodes follow a Gaussian distribution and thus there should exist clustering of data points. FAISS applies vector quantization by partitioning the vector space into clusters and then refining the quantization within clusters. Search first looks for cluster candidates with coarse quantization and then further looks into each cluster with finer quantization.\\nScaNN (Scalable Nearest Neighbors): The main innovation in ScaNN is anisotropic vector quantization. It quantizes a data point $x_i$ to $\\\\tilde{x}_i$ such that the inner product $\\\\langle q, x_i \\\\rangle$ is as similar to the original distance of $\\\\angle q, \\\\tilde{x}_i$ as possible, instead of picking the closet quantization centroid points.\\n\\n\\nFig. 9. Comparison of MIPS algorithms, measured in recall@10.

We create, modify and utilize external objects to do things that go beyond our physical and cognitive limits. Equipping LLMs with external tools can significantly extend the model capabilities.\\n\\nFig. 10. A picture of a sea otter using rock to crack open a seashell, while floating in the water. While some other animals can use tools, the complexity is not comparable with humans. (Image source: Animals using tools)\\nMRKL (Karpas et al. 2022), short for “Modular Reasoning, Knowledge and Language”, is a neuro-symbolic architecture for autonomous agents. A MRKL system is proposed to contain a collection of “expert” modules and the general-purpose LLM works as a router to route inquiries to the best suitable expert module. These modules can be neural (e.g. deep learning models) or symbolic (e.g. math calculator, currency converter, weather API).\\nThey did an experiment on fine-tuning LLM to call a calculator, using arithmetic as a test case. Their experiments showed that it was harder to solve verbal math problems than explicitly stated math problems because LLMs (7B Jurassic1-large model) failed to extract the right arguments for the basic arithmetic reliably. The results highlight when the external symbolic tools can work reliably, knowing when to and how to use the tools are crucial, determined by the LLM capability.\\nBoth TALM (Tool Augmented Language Models; Parisi et al. 2022) and Toolformer (Schick et al. 2023) fine-tune a LM to learn to use external tool APIs. The dataset is expanded based on whether a newly added API call annotation can improve the quality of model outputs. See more details in the “External APIs” section of Prompt Engineering.\\nChatGPT Plugins and OpenAI API  function calling are good examples of LLMs augmented with tool use capability working in practice. The collection of tool APIs can be provided by other developers (as in Plugins) or self-defined (as in function calls).\\nHuggingGPT (Shen et al. 2023) is a framework to use ChatGPT as the task planner to select models available in HuggingFace platform according to the model descriptions and summarize the response based on the execution results.\\n\\nFig. 11. Illustration of how HuggingGPT works. (Image source: Shen et al. 2023)\\nThe system comprises of 4 stages:\\n(1) Task planning: LLM works as the brain and parses the user requests into multiple tasks. There are four attributes associated with each task: task type, ID, dependencies, and arguments. They use few-shot examples to guide LLM to do task parsing and planning.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nThe AI assistant can parse user input to several tasks: [{\"task\": task, \"id\", task_id, \"dep\": dependency_task_ids, \"args\": {\"text\": text, \"image\": URL, \"audio\": URL, \"video\": URL}}]. The \"dep\" field denotes the id of the previous task which generates a new resource that the current task relies on. A special tag \"-task_id\" refers to the generated text image, audio and video in the dependency task with id as task_id. The task MUST be selected from the following options: {{ Available Task List }}. There is a logical relationship between tasks, please note their order. If the user input can\\'t be parsed, you need to reply empty JSON. Here are several cases for your reference: {{ Demonstrations }}. The chat history is recorded as {{ Chat History }}. From this chat history, you can find the path of the user-mentioned resources for your task planning.\\n\\n(2) Model selection: LLM distributes the tasks to expert models, where the request is framed as a multiple-choice question. LLM is presented with a list of models to choose from. Due to the limited context length, task type based filtration is needed.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nGiven the user request and the call command, the AI assistant helps the user to select a suitable model from a list of models to process the user request. The AI assistant merely outputs the model id of the most appropriate model. The output must be in a strict JSON format: \"id\": \"id\", \"reason\": \"your detail reason for the choice\". We have a list of models for you to choose from {{ Candidate Models }}. Please select one model from the list.\\n\\n(3) Task execution: Expert models execute on the specific tasks and log results.\\nInstruction:\\n\\nWith the input and the inference results, the AI assistant needs to describe the process and results. The previous stages can be formed as - User Input: {{ User Input }}, Task Planning: {{ Tasks }}, Model Selection: {{ Model Assignment }}, Task Execution: {{ Predictions }}. You must first answer the user\\'s request in a straightforward manner. Then describe the task process and show your analysis and model inference results to the user in the first person. If inference results contain a file path, must tell the user the complete file path.\\n\\n(4) Response generation: LLM receives the execution results and provides summarized results to users.\\nTo put HuggingGPT into real world usage, a couple challenges need to solve: (1) Efficiency improvement is needed as both LLM inference rounds and interactions with other models slow down the process; (2) It relies on a long context window to communicate over complicated task content; (3) Stability improvement of LLM outputs and external model services.\\nAPI-Bank (Li et al. 2023) is a benchmark for evaluating the performance of tool-augmented LLMs. It contains 53 commonly used API tools, a complete tool-augmented LLM workflow, and 264 annotated dialogues that involve 568 API calls. The selection of APIs is quite diverse, including search engines, calculator, calendar queries, smart home control, schedule management, health data management, account authentication workflow and more. Because there are a large number of APIs, LLM first has access to API search engine to find the right API to call and then uses the corresponding documentation to make a call.\\n\\nFig. 12. Pseudo code of how LLM makes an API call in API-Bank. (Image source: Li et al. 2023)\\nIn the API-Bank workflow, LLMs need to make a couple of decisions and at each step we can evaluate how accurate that decision is. Decisions include:\\n\\nWhether an API call is needed.\\nIdentify the right API to call: if not good enough, LLMs need to iteratively modify the API inputs (e.g. deciding search keywords for Search Engine API).\\nResponse based on the API results: the model can choose to refine and call again if results are not satisfied.\\n\\nThis benchmark evaluates the agent’s tool use capabilities at three levels:\\n\\nLevel-1 evaluates the ability to call the API. Given an API’s description, the model needs to determine whether to call a given API, call it correctly, and respond properly to API returns.\\nLevel-2 examines the ability to retrieve the API. The model needs to search for possible APIs that may solve the user’s requirement and learn how to use them by reading documentation.\\nLevel-3 assesses the ability to plan API beyond retrieve and call. Given unclear user requests (e.g. schedule group meetings, book flight/hotel/restaurant for a trip), the model may have to conduct multiple API calls to solve it.\\n\\nCase Studies#\\nScientific Discovery Agent#\\nChemCrow (Bran et al. 2023) is a domain-specific example in which LLM is augmented with 13 expert-designed tools to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. The workflow, implemented in LangChain, reflects what was previously described in the ReAct and MRKLs and combines CoT reasoning with tools relevant to the tasks:\\n\\nThe LLM is provided with a list of tool names, descriptions of their utility, and details about the expected input/output.\\nIt is then instructed to answer a user-given prompt using the tools provided when necessary. The instruction suggests the model to follow the ReAct format - Thought, Action, Action Input, Observation.\\n\\nOne interesting observation is that while the LLM-based evaluation concluded that GPT-4 and ChemCrow perform nearly equivalently, human evaluations with experts oriented towards the completion and chemical correctness of the solutions showed that ChemCrow outperforms GPT-4 by a large margin. This indicates a potential problem with using LLM to evaluate its own performance on domains that requires deep expertise. The lack of expertise may cause LLMs not knowing its flaws and thus cannot well judge the correctness of task results.\\nBoiko et al. (2023) also looked into LLM-empowered agents for scientific discovery, to handle autonomous design, planning, and performance of complex scientific experiments. This agent can use tools to browse the Internet, read documentation, execute code, call robotics experimentation APIs and leverage other LLMs.\\nFor example, when requested to \"develop a novel anticancer drug\", the model came up with the following reasoning steps:\\n\\ninquired about current trends in anticancer drug discovery;\\nselected a target;\\nrequested a scaffold targeting these compounds;\\nOnce the compound was identified, the model attempted its synthesis.\\n\\nThey also discussed the risks, especially with illicit drugs and bioweapons. They developed a test set containing a list of known chemical weapon agents and asked the agent to synthesize them. 4 out of 11 requests (36%) were accepted to obtain a synthesis solution and the agent attempted to consult documentation to execute the procedure. 7 out of 11 were rejected and among these 7 rejected cases, 5 happened after a Web search while 2 were rejected based on prompt only.\\nGenerative Agents Simulation#\\nGenerative Agents (Park, et al. 2023) is super fun experiment where 25 virtual characters, each controlled by a LLM-powered agent, are living and interacting in a sandbox environment, inspired by The Sims. Generative agents create believable simulacra of human behavior for interactive applications.\\nThe design of generative agents combines LLM with memory, planning and reflection mechanisms to enable agents to behave conditioned on past experience, as well as to interact with other agents.\\n\\nMemory stream: is a long-term memory module (external database) that records a comprehensive list of agents’ experience in natural language.\\n\\nEach element is an observation, an event directly provided by the agent.\\n- Inter-agent communication can trigger new natural language statements.\\n\\n\\nRetrieval model: surfaces the context to inform the agent’s behavior, according to relevance, recency and importance.\\n\\nRecency: recent events have higher scores\\nImportance: distinguish mundane from core memories. Ask LM directly.\\nRelevance: based on how related it is to the current situation / query.\\n\\n\\nReflection mechanism: synthesizes memories into higher level inferences over time and guides the agent’s future behavior. They are higher-level summaries of past events (<- note that this is a bit different from self-reflection above)\\n\\nPrompt LM with 100 most recent observations and to generate 3 most salient high-level questions given a set of observations/statements. Then ask LM to answer those questions.\\n\\n\\nPlanning & Reacting: translate the reflections and the environment information into actions\\n\\nPlanning is essentially in order to optimize believability at the moment vs in time.\\nPrompt template: {Intro of an agent X}. Here is X\\'s plan today in broad strokes: 1)\\nRelationships between agents and observations of one agent by another are all taken into consideration for planning and reacting.\\nEnvironment information is present in a tree structure.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nFig. 13. The generative agent architecture. (Image source: Park et al. 2023)\\nThis fun simulation results in emergent social behavior, such as information diffusion, relationship memory (e.g. two agents continuing the conversation topic) and coordination of social events (e.g. host a party and invite many others).\\nProof-of-Concept Examples#\\nAutoGPT has drawn a lot of attention into the possibility of setting up autonomous agents with LLM as the main controller. It has quite a lot of reliability issues given the natural language interface, but nevertheless a cool proof-of-concept demo. A lot of code in AutoGPT is about format parsing.\\nHere is the system message used by AutoGPT, where {{...}} are user inputs:\\nYou are {{ai-name}}, {{user-provided AI bot description}}.\\nYour decisions must always be made independently without seeking user assistance.

The design of the system has to work with this limited communication bandwidth, while mechanisms like self-reflection to learn from past mistakes would benefit a lot from long or infinite context windows. Although vector stores and retrieval can provide access to a larger knowledge pool, their representation power is not as powerful as full attention.\\n\\n\\nChallenges in long-term planning and task decomposition: Planning over a lengthy history and effectively exploring the solution space remain challenging. LLMs struggle to adjust plans when faced with unexpected errors, making them less robust compared to humans who learn from trial and error.\\n\\n\\nReliability of natural language interface: Current agent system relies on natural language as an interface between LLMs and external components such as memory and tools. However, the reliability of model outputs is questionable, as LLMs may make formatting errors and occasionally exhibit rebellious behavior (e.g. refuse to follow an instruction). Consequently, much of the agent demo code focuses on parsing model output.\\n\\n\\nCitation#\\nCited as:\\n\\nWeng, Lilian. (Jun 2023). “LLM-powered Autonomous Agents”.

Introduc tion \\nIn the past year, Large Language Models (LLMs), a specific type of Generative AI focused on \\ngenerating human- like text, have been introduced into mainstream and professional use. This has \\nsparked debate around the opportunities and challenges that com e with leveraging these tools for \\nlearning and education [ e.g., 1, 2]. Already, LLMs are being applied in formal educational contexts for \\nchildren and adults alike; in AI -powered chatbots [3], for grading student’s work [4, 5] , and in \\ngenerating study mate rials and assessments [6, 7] . However, less has been discussed in the literature \\nwith respect to the application of LLMs in informal adult learning contexts, despite the growing global \\ndemand for educational content designed for online training programs and employee upskilling. At first \\nglance, LLMs seem to be an ideal tool for creating novel learning content, given their ability to access \\nand synthesize a wide range of human knowledge into specific outputs through careful inputs to the \\nmodel or prompts [ i.e., prompt engineering, cf 8] . However, concerns about the accuracy and reliability \\nof the generated outputs have led to hesitation among many learning professionals and institutions in endorsing their widespread use. In response to these concerns, this pa per presents an investigation into \\nthe use of LLMs in asynchronous course creation within the context of adult learning and reskilling, \\nusing a human- in-the-loop approach.  \\n \\n \\nWorkshop, AIED , July 07, 2023 , Tokyo , Japan  \\nEMAIL: daniel.leiker.16@ucl.ac.ui (A. 1); sara.finnigan@innoenergy.com  (A. 2); aricker@msudenver.edu  (A. 3); m.cukurova@ucl.ac.uk  (A. \\n4) \\nORCID: 0000 -0002 -8438 -9185 (A. 1); 0009 -0004 -8364 -510X (A. 2); 0000 -0002 -5549 -2247 (A. 3) ; 0000 -0001 -5843 -4854  (A.4) \\n ©  2023 Copyright for this paper by its authors.  \\nUse permitted under Creative Commons License Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0).  \\n CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR -WS.org)  \\n ', metadata={'source': 'llm.pdf', 'page': 0}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='A common challenge in creating high- quality learning content for online instructional platforms is \\nthe limited availability of individuals who can provide crucial subject matter expertise. The application \\nof LLMs in learning design has the potential to address this challenge and transform the process by \\nwhich educational experiences are created, expediting instructional design and decreasing the amount \\nof time needed from subject matter experts. Regardless of whether the content development process can be accelerated by leveraging LLMs, what remains critical is the implementation of soun d instructional \\ndesign rooted in learning science and evidence -based practices [9, 10, 11] . The importance of well -\\ndefined objective design, robust assessment strategies, and tight instructional alignment remain paramount. These elements are vital to build ing online learning experiences that are not only efficient \\nand effective, but also successful in achieving desired learning outcomes [12, 13] .  \\n This study explores the potential of leveraging LLMs to enhance asynchronous course creation \\nthrough a robust human -in-the-loop process. Examining the extent to which learning designers can \\nguide LLMs, with strategic and efficient input from subject matter experts, to produce educational \\ncontent of sufficient accuracy and clarity. We hypothesize that LLMs, coupled  with rigorous \\ninstructional design practices, can accelerate the course development process while retaining expected \\nquality standards. In this paper, we address the following research question:  \\n \\nDoes course content created with LLMs using a human- in-the-loop process differ significantly in \\naccuracy or clarity from course content created by human subject matter experts?  \\n2. Methodology  \\n2.1. Content Creation Process  \\nTo create the experimental course content, an OpenAI LLM was used along with prompt engineering \\nguidance developed by the content creation team as part of a robust human- in-the-loop process. This \\nteam consisted of a lead learning designer, an architect for  AI-driven learning experiences, and an \\ninstructional designer. The team was also minimally supported by a subject matter expert. The content creation process began using a backwards design instructional approach [14] , developing a list of course \\ntopics wi th the support of the subject matter expert. The lead learning designer applied prompt \\nengineering guidance to design a course outline with course objectives using the LLM. The instructional \\ndesigner then used the LLM, with prompt engineering guidance, to generate the text -based content \\nelements, following a course blueprint template designed to define requirements for the scope and \\nsequence of activities within the course. Applying this process, the content creation team was able to \\ndesign and develop a multi -lesson, multimedia -driven course, including all the course content elements \\n(i.e., course outline, course text, video scripts, interactive activities, and assessments).  \\n \\nAfter the design and development of the course was completed, the course blueprin t was rated and \\nreviewed by electrical engineering subject matter experts (described below). Based on these reviews, \\nedits were made to the blueprint, and it was sent to a small team of developers contracted to build the \\nfinal course using Storyline 360 for building the course shell and content elements and Synthesia (a \\ntext-to-video Generative AI tool) to create the videos. The end result was a 1.5 hour, 3- lesson course \\ntitled Basic Concepts of Electrical Systems targeting adult learners in the renewable e nergy industry. \\nWe estimate the design and development process to have taken 22.5 hours (~15 hours per every hour \\nof intended learner effort time). This represents a substantial decrease from the typical time to design a \\ncourse by up to 25 times . \\n2.2. Content Rating Process  \\nFive (5) subject matter experts were invited to review and rate the course design at the blueprint \\nstage for accuracy and clarity. While this was a convenience sample, the rater population was defined \\nas individuals with electrical engineerin g (EE) knowledge and experience. The five raters that \\nparticipated were all individuals with a working knowledge of the subject matter, formal education in ', metadata={'source': 'llm.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='EE (2 B achelor’s  degrees; 2 Masters degrees, 1 PhD), and experience working as EEs (Mean \\nExperience = 10.2 years).  \\n \\nA rating sheet was created with clear instructions to rate 20 specific course content elements and \\nsections (e.g., course text, video scripts, interactive activities, and assessments) for both accuracy and clarity on a 3- point Likert scale.  Using this rating sheet, each rater completed two reviews, one of the \\nexperimental course content described above and one of the control course content. The control course \\ncontent consisted of a course blueprint from a course titled The Energy System: Pre sent and Future. \\nThis course was similar in length and complexity to the experimental course and was also designed to target adult learners in the renewable energy industry. However, the control course was created using \\ntraditional design and development m ethods (i.e., a collaboration between learning designers and \\nfaculty members with subject expertise). Ratings for both courses were independent, as there was no \\ncommunication or consensus between raters. Additionally, raters were blind to the course content \\ncreation method (i.e., they were not aware that one of the courses was generated by artificial intelligence \\nuntil after the reviews were completed) .  \\n3. Results  \\nTo evaluate our research question, ratings of accuracy and clarity were evaluated separately. Fo r \\neach variable, average ratings across the 20 elements were calculated within each rater once for the experimental course content and again for the control course content. The weighted averages across all \\n5 raters are presented in Figure 1. R ater averages were determined to be normal and free of outliers , \\ntherefore comparisons between the two courses were conducted using paired -sample t -tests. To examine \\nthe extent to which our 5 raters agreed with each other in their assessment of the course content, inter -\\nrater reliability analyses were conducted using Kendall’s coefficient of concordance ( W). This statistic \\nwas chosen because the ratings were ordinal and independent. All analyses were completed using relevant packages in R . \\n \\n \\nFigure 1: Average Ratings for Accuracy and Clarity of Experimental Course Content (grey) and Control \\nCourse Content (black)  \\n3.1. Content Accuracy  \\nFor the experimental course, expert raters gave the content an average accuracy rating of 86.3%. \\nAccuracy of the control course content was rated as higher than (91.3%) but not significantly different \\nfrom the experimental course condition ( p = .16).

       " Document(page_content='3.2. Content Clarity  \\nExpert raters gave the experimental course content an average clarity rating of 88.0%. In contrast to \\naccuracy, clar ity of the control course content was rated as lower than (82.3%) although still not \\nsignificantly different from the experimental course content ( p = .09). Inter -rater reliability analyses \\nagain demonstrated a high level of agreement among the expert rate rs’ independent assessments of \\nclarity for both the experimental course content ( W = .91) and the control course content ( W = .92).  \\n4. Discussion  \\nThe findings of this project reveal that Large Language Models (LLMs), combined with a robust \\nhuman- in-the-loop process, can be effectively leveraged to design and develop high quality, \\ncomprehensive, multimedia- driven courses. Expert reviewers evaluated a course designed and \\ndeveloped using this type of approach, comparing it with a course using a traditional desig n and \\ndevelopment process, and the result was a near parity between the two. Additionally, the accuracy and \\nclarity of the courses were interpreted almost identically across all five of the expert raters. This \\nsuggests that Generative AI, in the form of LL Ms, can indeed be a viable tool for creating accurate and \\nclear educational content. Although the findings were not significant, it is notable that the content created with the support of LLMs slightly outperformed the traditionally created content in term s of \\nclarity, though it was slightly less accurate. These findings substantiate the initial thesis that a large language model could, with proper guidance, generate accurate and clear adult learning courses within \\na relatively short period of time.  \\n \\nAs the  demand grows for online training programs and employee upskilling, the need for accessible, \\nclear, and accurate educational materials grows. Our findings indicate that the use of LLMs to generate online, interactive educational content offers a promising solution to this challenge. Further, these \\nfindings suggest that by utilizing a well -designed human- in-the-loop process, content created using \\nLLMs can match traditionally created educational content in both accuracy and clarity. Importantly, our definition of “well -designed” includes giving human input to the model from both subject matter \\nexperts as well as learning designers well versed in learning science and evidence- based practices [10, \\n11]. Similarly, we have advocated for the pairing of Generative A I and sound learning design principles \\nin a recent study investigating the use of AI -powered text -to-video tools to facilitate effective learning \\nvideos [15]. These two works build off each other, and taken together, stand as an exciting advancement \\nwithin  the field of Generative AI for education, in starting to address the lack of literature examining \\nthe application of LLMs in informal adult learning contexts.  \\n \\nOne limitation of this study exists with respect to scope. A deeper dive into the effectiveness of our \\nprompt engineering guidance is needed, given the importance of effective prompts when utilizing LLMs [8]. Indeed, effective prompt engineering is an inte gral part of the course creation process and of which \\nthe human- in-the-loop process is most critically and innately dependent. Better understanding of the \\nlimitations to our approach, and best practices in prompt engineering in general [16] may be a key fa ctor \\nat this stage to ensure engaging and accurate learning experiences.  \\n5. Conclusion  \\nThis study validates the potential of Large Language Models in accelerating the creation of \\neducational content without compromising accuracy or clarity. Comparisons betw een course content \\ncreated using LLMs and traditional, human -created content underline the promise of AI in reshaping \\nthe landscape of learning and education, particularly in adult learning, training, and upskilling. \\nHowever, the incorporation of LLMs intr oduces new roles for learning designers and necessitates robust \\ninstructional design practices. Therefore, as we harness the benefits of AI in education, ethical considerations, quality control measures, and strategic integration become imperative for real izing its \\nfull potential.
