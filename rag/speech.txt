Today is 5th September and like every year we have assembled here to celebrate the Teachers Day. I am extremely honored to have been given the opportunity to host this program. On the day of teacher’s day, I would like to talk about one of the greatest personalities who I admire a lot, Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam. I am sure everyone admires the great missile man for his notable contributions to our nation.

Dr. APJ Kalam has been a great motivation for me and his entire life journey has played a very significant role in transforming my life in a positive way.

We all know that Dr. Kalam was an Indian scientist and a benevolent politician who served India as the President from the year 2002 to 2007. His full name was Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam. Born on October 15, 1931, into a Muslim family, Dr. Kalam was a sharp student and an obedient child who helped his family in earning the livelihood. He was born in Dhanushkodi located on the southeastern coast of India. As a child, Dr. Kalam developed a great fascination with air travel by watching birds. This hobby of Kalam later developed into a mission to join aeronautics; the mission got stronger after he saw an article in the newspaper about a British fighter plane.

His father’s profession was to build and rent boats. Kalam was a very bright and hardworking student. He distributed newspapers in his locality to support his father. But he always had great interest towards studies; he was a very promising student and showed enormous likings towards science and mathematics. Dr. Kalam went to St. Joseph’s College after passing from school and attended Madras Institute of Technology to earn his degree in aeronautical engineering.
